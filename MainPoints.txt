Design Principles:
------------------

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

- Program to an interface, not an implementation.

- Favor composition over inheritance (HAS-A can be better than IS-A)
	Not only does it let you encapsulate a family of algorithms into their own set of classes, but it also
	lets you change behavior at runtime as long as the object you're composing with implements the correct
	behavior interface.
